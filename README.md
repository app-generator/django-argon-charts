```

<br />

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

## Charts Feature

This section describes the coding process for this feature that allows authenticated users to update their orders and sales.

### `Orders` Table

This table will save the information shown in the charts on the main dashboard - Fields:

- ID: primary key
- Product Name: string
- Product Price: number
- Transac_date: transaction timetimestamp

<br />

### `Orders` Application

The application that manages and implements all features:

- Allow users to save and edit a new order
    - Via a popup window/separate window   
- Populate the information on the main dashboard as presented below: 
    - Widget 1: Total Sales (in value)
    - Widget 2: Peek Sale - transaction with Biggest Value
    - Widget 3: Total Orders (sum up of all transactions)
    - Widget 4: Best Month - selected by the number of orders
    - Line Chart shows the sales for a 12mo timeframe
    - Bar Chart shows the sales for a 12mo timeframe

<br />

### Additional help

This section provides more information (especially for beginners) to understand and use the project much faster.

**How to create a new application in Django**

Each application you write in Django consists of a Python package that follows a certain convention. Django comes with a utility that automatically generates the basic directory structure of an app, so you can focus on writing code rather than creating directories.

To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as `manage.py` and type this command:

```bash
$ python manage.py startapp app
```

That’ll create a directory `app`, which is laid out like this:

```bash
|-- app/
    |-- migrations/
        |-- __init__.py
    |-- __init__.py
    |-- admin.py
    |-- apps.py
    |-- models.py
    |-- tests.py
    |-- views.py
```

Now, open up `core/settings.py`. It’s a normal Python module with module-level variables representing Django settings.

Note the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of all Django applications that are activated in this Django instance.

By default, `INSTALLED_APPS` contains the following apps, all of which come with Django:

- **django.contrib.admin:** The admin site. You’ll use it shortly.
- **django.contrib.auth:** An authentication system.
- **django.contrib.contenttypes:** A framework for content types.
- **django.contrib.sessions:** A session framework.
- **django.contrib.messages:** A messaging framework.
- **django.contrib.staticfiles:** A framework for managing static files.

> These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.

Now add your created app to the `INSTALLED_APPS`, so you can use it.

`core/settings.py`
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [    
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    
    'app',

]
```

<br />

**How to define a new table**

First we need to open and edit the `app/models.py` file. In our app, we’ll create a model named **Order**.

These concepts are represented by Python classes. Edit the `app/models.py` file so it looks like this:

```python
from django.db import models

class Order(models.Model):
    product_name = models.CharField(max_length=40)
    price = models.FloatField()
    created_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, db_index=True)
    updated_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'order'
        verbose_name_plural = 'orders'
```

Here, each model is represented by a class that subclasses `django.db.models.Model`. Each model has a number of class variables, each of which represents a database field in the model.

Each field is represented by an instance of a **Field** class, e.g., **CharField** for character fields and **DateTimeField** for datetimes, and **FloatField** for float numbers. This tells Django what type of data each field holds.

Now Django knows to include the app. Let’s run another command:

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations app
```

You should see something similar to the following:

```bash
Migrations for 'app':
  app/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Order
```

> By running `makemigrations`, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration.

Now, run migrate again to create those model tables in your database:

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

> The `migrate` command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied and run them against your database. Essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database.
